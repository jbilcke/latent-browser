## Presentation

this project is free but experimental, you will have to configure your own API credentials to access OpenAI (for GPT-3 / text-davinci-003 / gpt-3.5-turbo / gpt-4, and dall-e 2).

Currently Replicate (stable diffusion) is disabled, as I had some latency issues with it (maybe I will put it back in the future!)

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

You will need NVM and Node 18.12.1

### Initial setup

```bash
cd web4
nvm use
yarn
```

Don't mind too much those errors (we don't use IPFS yet):

```
electron@npm:1.8.8 couldn't be built successfully
wrtc@npm:0.4.7 couldn't be built successfully
```

The app will still load just fine.

### BEFORE YOU RUN THE APP /!\

This application is based on OpenAI for text and image generation.

\*You need a valid (billable) OpenAI account before you can use the application.

Upon starting it, you will have to enter you OpenAI token in the configuration panel (the "cog" icon).

### Running the app in development

You have 3 different options to run the app:

#### In a browser (recommended)

This solution is recommended during development or if you experience build issues.

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then go to http://localhost:1420

#### In a standalone browser (advanced)

This solution requires a working Rust environment, and is recommended if you need to develop things interacting with the OS (eg. custom windows, system toolbar, auto updater..)

```bash
yarn tauri:dev
```

#### Generate a production build for yourselves (advanced)

This is not recommended for day-to-day development as it is slow, and currently there is an issue with images.

```bash
yarn tauri build
```

then:

- copy the app to your Application dir
- start the app

### Known important bugs

Images don't seem to work when runing a standalone built using `yarn tauri build`, it might be caused by a security setting.

## Using the browser

### Working (most of the time) examples

Here are some examples to get you started:

- `a back-office application to manage users. There is a table with editable cells, a button to add a new user, and a counter of users.`
- `a simulation of calculating PI by generating random dots inside a circle. The simulator should include a slider to adjust the speed, a reset button, and the current estimate of PI.`
- `a simple app to compute your BMI, using form inputs for age, height and weight (in kilos)`
- `a whack-a-mole game but with spiders, a css 3-per-3 grid, emojis, and JS code`
- `a clone of asteroid using <canvas>, the mouse should orient the spaceship, it should fire bullets when clicking, and bullets can destroy asteroids.`
- `website for a company selling time travel visit packages (great pyramids, Trojan wars..). The website features 3 polaroid pictures taken by tourists of those eras`

### Non-working examples

Those examples don't work yet.. maybe one day in text-davinci-004 or 005?

- `a 120 BPM drum machine made using tone.js, with a step sequencer made using html checkboxes, to indicate when to play. Each row should be a different instrument (kick, snare, hihat), 8 buttons per row. There is a button to start/stop.`

## FAQ

### The UI/UX should be improved

I agree!

### Uhh.. something went wrong

Try clicking again on generate ðŸŽ²

### No I mean, something went REALLY wrong

Maybe you did too many requests to OpenAI?

### I don't.. know?

Wait a bit then restart the application, eg. kill it from the terminal.

## Developer Guide (work in progress)

### HTTP Request Mocking

Today web4 can mock the following file formats when the generated code tries to access them:

- `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webm`, `.tga`, `.gif`, `.bmp` -> `mockImage(filename)`
- `.json` -> `mockJSON(filename)`
- `.txt` -> `mockText(filename)`
- `.stl` -> `mockSTL(filename)`
- `.svg` -> `mockSVG(filename)`
- `.*` -> `mockAny(filename, extension)`

You can find the code doing the mocking in `src/pages/api/mocker/[filename].ts`.

You can find the mocking prompts in `src/engine/prompts/mocker/`.

Do not hesitate to propose improvements to those prompts!
